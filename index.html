                    The types of the C# language are divided into two main categories: reference types and value types. Both value types and reference types may be generic types, which take one or more type parameters. Type parameters can designate both value types and reference types.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-csharp">
type
    : reference_type
    | value_type
    | type_parameter
    // unsafe code support
    | pointer_type
    ;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Value types differ from reference types in that variables of the value types directly contain their data, whereas variables of the reference types store references to their data, the latter being known as objects. With reference types, it is possible for two variables to reference the same object, and thus possible for operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by the other variable. With value types, the variables each have their own copy of the data, and it is not possible for operations on one to affect the other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C#'s type system is unified such that a value of any type can be treated as an object. Every type in C# directly or indirectly derives from the object class type, and object is the ultimate base class of all types. Values of reference types are treated as objects simply by viewing the values as type object. Values of value types are treated as objects by performing boxing and unboxing operations.

                <p>
                    Variables represent storage locations. Every variable has a type that determines what values can be stored in the variable. C# is a type-safe language, and the C# compiler guarantees that values stored in variables are always of the appropriate type. The value of a variable can be changed through assignment or through use of the <code class="language-csharp">++</code> and <code class="language-csharp">--</code> operators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A variable shall be definitely assigned before its value can be obtained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Variables are either initially assigned or initially unassigned. An initially assigned variable has a well-defined initial value and is always considered definitely assigned. An initially unassigned variable has no initial value. For an initially unassigned variable to be considered definitely assigned at a certain location, an assignment to the variable shall occur in every possible execution path leading to that location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C# defines seven categories of variables: static variables, instance variables, array elements, value parameters, reference parameters, output parameters, and local variables. The subclauses that follow describe each of these categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: In the following code...
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-csharp">
class A
{
    public static int x;
    int y;

    void F(int[] v, int a, ref int b, out int c)
    {
        int i = 1;
        c = a + b++;
    }
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    ... <code class="language-charp">x</code> is a static variable, <code class="language-charp">y</code> is an instance variable, <code class="language-charp">v[0]</code> is an array element, <code class="language-charp">a</code> is a value parameter, <code class="language-charp">b</code> is a reference parameter, <code class="language-charp">c</code> is an output parameter, and <code class="language-charp">i</code> is a local variable.

                    A class declaration that supplies a type_parameter_list is a generic class declaration. Additionally, any class nested inside a generic class declaration or a generic struct declaration is itself a generic class declaration, since type arguments for the containing type shall be supplied to create a constructed type.

                    Structs are similar to classes in that they represent data structures that can contain data members and function members. However, unlike classes, structs are value types and do not require heap allocation. A variable of a <code class="language-csharp">struct</code> type directly contains the data of the <code class="language-csharp">struct</code>, whereas a variable of a class type contains a reference to the data, the latter known as an object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The simple types provided by C#, such as int, double, and bool, are, in fact, all struct types.

                    An array is a data structure that contains a number of variables that are accessed through computed indices. The variables contained in an array, also called the elements of the array, are all of the same type, and this type is called the element type of the array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An array has a rank that determines the number of indices associated with each array element. The rank of an array is also referred to as the dimensions of the array. An array with a rank of one is called a single-dimensional array. An array with a rank greater than one is called a multi-dimensional array. Specific sized multi-dimensional arrays are often referred to as two-dimensional arrays, three-dimensional arrays, and so on. Each dimension of an array has an associated length that is an integral number greater than or equal to zero. The dimension lengths are not part of the type of the array, but rather are established when an instance of the array type is created at run-time. The length of a dimension determines the valid range of indices for that dimension: For a dimension of length <code class="language-csharp">N</code>, indices can range from <code class="language-csharp">0</code> to <code class="language-csharp">N - 1</code> inclusive. The total number of elements in an array is the product of the lengths of each dimension in the array. If one or more of the dimensions of an array have a length of zero, the array is said to be empty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The element type of an array can itself be an array type. Such arrays of arrays are distinct from multi-dimensional arrays and can be used to represent "jagged arrays".
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-csharp">
int[][] pascals = {
    new int[] {1},
    new int[] {1, 1},
    new int[] {1, 2, 1},

                <p>
                    Every array type is a reference type. The element type of an array can be any type, including value types and array types.

                    An interface defines a contract. A class or struct that implements an interface shall adhere to its contract. An interface may inherit from multiple base interfaces, and a class or struct may implement multiple interfaces.

                <P>
                    Interfaces can contain methods, properties, events, and indexers. The interface itself does not provide implementations for the members that it declares. The interface merely specifies the members that shall be supplied by classes or structs that implement the interface.
